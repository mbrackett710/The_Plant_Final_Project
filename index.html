							<p class="paragraph">The Plant is proud to serve tasty, wholesome food that’s sustainable and economical. Everything we serve is totally organic and local sourced, which means the freshest produce from around the bay area, free range poultry, and seafood from sources that are both wild and sustainable.</p>

							<p class="paragraph">At the Plant, we serve California Cuisine with an Asian flair. Juices and smoothies, salads, sandwiches, pastas, poultry, seafood and deserts– all organic, ethically produced and freshly made. We’re so committed to nurturing the relationship between humans and the earth that even our restaurants themselves are constructed in the greenest way possible, lowering carbon emissions.</p>

							<h3>Why Organic ?</h3>

							<p class="paragraph">Organic produce employs pesticides and fertilizers processed from natural sources, while conventional farming utilizes strong chemically synthesized agents, many of which are shown to be damaging to health and the environment. We’re proud to support the organic foods movement, and to serve food that is healthy for our customers and the local ecosystem. </p>

							<p class="paragraph">Organic, locally farmed produce is usually picked when it’s ripe and at its peak flavor and nutritional value, instead of when picked early and shipped over long distances. Organic certification ensures that food has been grown and handled carefully to avoid the use of unwanted chemicals, preservatives, antibiotics, growth hormones and GMO’s. Additionally, organic farming uses less water and has much less negative impact on the environment than conventional farming. By supporting local farmers, The Plant helps ensure local biodiversity and the economic survival of small, family farmers.</p>

							<h3>About Us</h3>

							<p class="paragraph">We’re very proud to offer the creations of Executive Chef Sascha Weiss, a local leader in the food industry, specializing in vegan, raw, and natural foods. He shaped the vision of the Plant: to make the best food available to everyone.</p>
